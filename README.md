This repository is a short script that reads your midi inputs and clicks or holds a key on your keyboard based on them.
There isn't much information about working with MIDI devices via python on the internet, and I don't have much 
knowledge about this stuff either, so I would apreciate any recommendations about my code and ideas for expanding it!
Feel free to clone and edit the script based on your preferences.
